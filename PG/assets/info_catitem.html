<H2>What is this information?</H2>
<P>
Selecting any item, for example Health Condition - Heart attack,
 displays a list of variants or SNPs (places of potential genetic typos).
 </P>
 <P>
The first row for each SNP shows where the variant is: the Locus, Gene, and Variant (SNP) number.
</P>
<P>
 The second row shows the normal type (e.g.; no mutation) for 23andMe data (if it exists) in black,
 your 23andMe data (if loaded) with normal alleles in green and mutations (polymorphisms) in red.
 </P>
 <P>
 Stars (from 1 - 5) indicate the research quality of the SNP (per the journal ranking of the study, the number
 of cases and controls, etc.)
</P>
<P>
The colored blocks show which service providers cite the SNP (per color legend below), and
 how many studies they cite.
 </P>
 <H2>What does this information mean?</H2>
 <P>
In Health Conditions, a mutation (polymorphism) presented in red generally indicates being at higher
 potential risk for developing a condition.
 </P>
 <P>
In Drug Response, a mutation could mean that the normal dose of the drug may not work as well,
 that there could be side effects, or that there could be a higher chance of addiction (for substances).
</P>
<P>
In Athletic Performance, the favorable mutation (green), suggests greater than average athletic capability.
