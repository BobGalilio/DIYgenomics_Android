1,Achilles tendon strength,The Achilles tendon is the largest tendon in the body. It connects the calf muscle to the heel bone and is used for walking running or jumping. An Achilles heel injury can be a incredible hindrance to any athlete's performance and can often take months to heal.,Mayo Clinic,http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/achilles-tendon-rupture/DS00160,http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=achilles+tendon
2,Endurance,Endurance is important to any athlete but especially for those training for marathons triathlons and any distance sport. Top-performance athletes often have what is called the Marathon genes.,About.com Sports Medicine,http://sportsmedicine.about.com/cs/strengthening/a/aa123098a.htm,http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=endurance
3,Energy,Energy is the body's regulation of energy metabolism mitochondrial biogenesis and skeletal muscle fibre-type conversion to help achieve peak performance.,Pubmed,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20044476,http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=exercise+energy
4,Heart capacity,Heart function directly impacts exercise and vice-versa. While research has proven that regular exercise enlarges the heart and strengthens the chambers some individuals may have genes that give them better heart capacity allowing for better endurance and strength in exercise. Heart capacity diminishes as our body ages so it is especially important to maintain and monitor our heart's condition.,Science Daily,http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/04/080422103857.htm,http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=heart+AND+athletic
5,Ligament strength,Ligaments are designed to passively stabilize joints. Strong tendons and ligaments promote healthier joints and minimizes injuries. Those with the favorable allele may have stronger ligaments than the general population allowing for better performance and less risk of injury.,Mayo Clinic,http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/acl-injury/DS00898,http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=ligament
6,Lung capacity,The intake of oxygen is important during exercise. Lung capacity affects the body's ability to take in oxygen and distribute it to cells providing energy for exercise and training.,Livestrong,http://www.livestrong.com/article/282195-why-are-lungs-important-for-a-sports-man-or-woman/,http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=lung+athletic
7,Metabolism,Metabolism involves a complex set of enzymes and hormones that that convert food into fuel. Individuals with higher metabolisms often burn fuel more efficiently. Many factors affect metabolism including: diet exercise age and genetic code.,Pubmed,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20044476,http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=metabolism+athletic
8,Muscle fatigue,Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) describes a phenomenon of muscle pain muscle soreness or muscle stiffness that is felt 12-48 hours after exercise particularly at the beginning of a new an exercise program after a change in sports activities or after a dramatic increase in the duration or intensity of exercise.,About.com Sports Medicine,http://sportsmedicine.about.com/cs/injuries/a/doms.htm,http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=muscle+fatigue
9,Muscle repair,Muscles are important to all aspects of exercise and fitness. After exercise a muscle needs anywhere from 24 to 48 hours to repair and rebuild and working it again too soon simply leads to tissue breakdown instead of building. ,About.com Sports Medicine,http://sportsmedicine.about.com/od/sampleworkouts/a/After-Exercise.htm,http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=muscle+repair
10,Power,Power is about the ability to exert maximum muscular contraction instantly in an explosive burst of movement kind of like a rocket taking off into space. The two components of power in terms of athletics are strength and speed. Power athletes are physically different in their abilities from endurance athletes and genes are partially involved in this difference.,Athlepedia,http://athletics.wikia.com/wiki/Power,http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=sprinting
11,Propensity to exercise,Propensity to exercise is the motivation that drive us to exercise - something that gets us moving. This can be a combination of genetic environmental physiological and mental factors. ,About.com Sports Medicine,http://exercise.about.com/od/plateausmotivation/a/motivation.htm,http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=propensity+exercise
12,Recovery,How our muscles and bodies heal and recover after workouts is as important as how our bodies react during workouts. Genes too are involved in the body's ability to recover. ,About.com Sports Medicine,http://sportsmedicine.about.com/od/sampleworkouts/a/After-Exercise.htm,http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=muscle+recovery
13,Strength,Strength includes strength exercise selection frequency of strength training sessions the number of sets performed and the number of repetitions performed per set.,About.com Sports Medicine,http://sportsmedicine.about.com/od/strengthtraining/a/strength_strat.htm,http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=muscle+strength
