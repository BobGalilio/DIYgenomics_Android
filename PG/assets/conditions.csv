1,Alzheimer's disease,Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related non-reversible brain disorder that develops over a period of years. Initially people experience memory loss and confusion which may be mistaken for the kinds of memory changes that are sometimes associated with normal aging.,NIH,http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/alzheimersdisease/alzheimersdisease.htm,http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/alzheimersdisease/alzheimersdisease.htm#What_is_the_prognosis,http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/alzheimersdisease/alzheimersdisease.htm#Is_there_any_treatment,http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/alzheimersdisease/alzheimersdisease.htm#Clinical_trials
2,Atrial fibrillation,Atrial fibrillation is when the heart's two small upper chambers?(the atria) quiver instead of beating effectively. Blood isn't pumped completely out of them so it may pool and clot. If a piece of a blood clot in the atria leaves the heart and becomes lodged in an artery in the brain a stroke results. ,AHA,http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4451,http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4451,http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4451,http://www.hrsonline.org/education/selfstudy/clinicaltrials/af/
3,Breast cancer,Breast cancer is a cancer that forms in tissues of the breast usually the ducts (tubes that carry milk to the nipple) and lobules (glands that make milk). It occurs in both men and women although male breast cancer is rare.,NIH,http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/types/breast,http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/prevention-genetics-causes/breast,http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/treatment/breast,http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/results/type/breast
4,Celiac disease,Celiac disease (CD) also referred to as gluten sensitive enteropathy (GSE) is a chronic inherited digestive disease that is the result of an immune system response to the ingestion of gluten (a protein found in wheat rye and barley) that damages the small intestine.,GIG,http://www.gluten.net/publications.php,http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/celiac/#examples,http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/celiac/#treatment,http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=celiac+disease
5,Colorectal cancer,Colorectal cancer is a cancer that forms in the tissues of the colon (the longest part of the large intestine). Most colon cancers are adenocarcinomas (cancers that begin in cells that make and release mucus and other fluids).,NIH,http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/types/colon-and-rectal,http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/prevention-genetics-causes/colon-and-rectal,http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/treatment/colon-and-rectal,http://www.cancer.gov/search/ResultsClinicalTrials.aspx?protocolsearchid=8342191&vers=1

7,Diabetes (type 1),Diabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose or sugar levels are too high. Glucose comes from the foods you eat. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy. With Type 1 diabetes your body does not make insulin. With Type 2 diabetes the more common type your body does not make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin the glucose stays in your blood.,NIH,http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/diabetes.html#cat11,http://www.healthfinder.gov/prevention/ViewTopic.aspx?topicID=73&cnt=1&areaID=1,http://diabetes.niddk.nih.gov/treatments/,http://www.diabetesnet.com/diabetes_complications/clinical_trials.php#axzz139AhEQJJ
8,Diabetes (type 2),Diabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose or sugar levels are too high. Glucose comes from the foods you eat. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy. With Type 1 diabetes your body does not make insulin. With Type 2 diabetes the more common type your body does not make or use insulin well.

9,Glaucoma,Glaucoma is a group of diseases that can damage the eye's optic nerve and result in vision loss and blindness. Glaucoma occurs when the normal fluid pressure inside the eyes slowly rises. However with early treatment you can often protect your eyes against serious vision loss.,NIH,http://www.nei.nih.gov/health/glaucoma/glaucoma_facts.asp,http://www.nei.nih.gov/health/glaucoma/glaucoma_facts.asp#2f,http://www.nei.nih.gov/health/glaucoma/glaucoma_facts.asp#4a,http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=glaucoma
10,Heart attack,A coronary attack (heart attack) occurs when the blood flow that brings oxygen to the heart muscle is severely reduced or cut off completely. This happens because coronary arteries that supply the heart with blood can slowly become thicker and harder from a buildup of fat cholesterol and other substances that together are called plaque. This slow process is known as atherosclerosis.,AHA,http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/HeartAttack/AboutHeartAttacks/About-Heart-Attacks_UCM_002038_Article.jsp,http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/HeartAttack/PreventionTreatmentofHeartAttack/Prevention-and-Treatment-of-Heart-Attack_UCM_002042_Article.jsp,http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/HeartAttack/PreventionTreatmentofHeartAttack/Prevention-and-Treatment-of-Heart-Attack_UCM_002042_Article.jsp,http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=heart+attack

People with SLE may experience fatigue pain or swelling in joints skin rashes and fevers.,CDC,http://www.cdc.gov/arthritis/basics/lupus.htm,http://www.niams.nih.gov/Health_Info/Lupus/Lupus_Guide/chapter_1.asp#chp1_sym,http://www.niams.nih.gov/Health_Info/Lupus/Lupus_Guide/chapter_1.asp#chp1_tre,http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=lupus
13,Macular degeneration,Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a disease associated with aging that gradually destroys sharp central vision. AMD affects the macula the part of the eye that allows you to see fine detail. AMD causes no pain. In some cases AMD advances so slowly that people notice little change in their vision. In others the disease progresses faster and may lead to a loss of vision in both eyes.,NIH,http://www.nei.nih.gov/health/maculardegen/armd_facts.asp,http://www.nei.nih.gov/health/maculardegen/armd_facts.asp#2b,http://www.nei.nih.gov/health/maculardegen/armd_facts.asp#1d,http://www.amd.org/research/dry-amd-research/dry-amd-clinical-trials.html
14,Multiple sclerosis,Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an unpredictable disease of the central nervous system. It can range from relatively benign to somewhat disabling to devastating as communication between the brain and other parts of the body is disrupted.?,NIH,http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/multiple_sclerosis/multiple_sclerosis.htm,http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/multiple_sclerosis/multiple_sclerosis.htm#What_is_the_prognosis,http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/multiple_sclerosis/multiple_sclerosis.htm#Is_there_any_treatment,http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/multiple_sclerosis/multiple_sclerosis.htm#Clinical_trials
15,Obesity,Obesity is having an abnormally high and unhealthy proportion of body fat. To measure obesity researchers commonly use a formula based on weight and height known as the body mass index (BMI). BMI is the ratio of weight (in kilograms) to height (in meters) squared. BMI provides a more accurate measure of obesity or being overweight than does weight alone.,NIH,http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/obesity,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/dci/Diseases/obe/obe_prevention.html,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/dci/Diseases/obe/obe_treatments.html,http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=obesity

Prostate cancer usually occurs in older men.,NIH,http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/types/prostate,http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/prevention-genetics-causes/prostate,http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/treatment/prostate,http://www.cancer.gov/Search/ClinicalTrialsLink.aspx?diagnosis=38782&format=1
17,Psoriasis,Psoriasis is a chronic (long-lasting) skin disease of scaling and inflammation that affects greater than 3 percent of the United States population or more than 5 million adults. Although the disease occurs in all age groups it primarily affects adults. It appears about equally in males and females.,NIH,http://www.niams.nih.gov/Health_Info/Psoriasis/default.asp,http://www.niams.nih.gov/Health_Info/Psoriasis/default.asp#3,http://www.niams.nih.gov/Health_Info/Psoriasis/default.asp#5,http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=psoriasis
18,Restless legs syndrome,Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurological disorder characterized by unpleasant sensations in the legs and an uncontrollable urge to move them for relief. Individuals affected with the disorder describe the sensations as burning creeping tugging or like insects crawling inside the legs. The sensations range in severity from uncomfortable to irritating to painful.,NIH,http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/restless_legs/restless_legs.htm,http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/restless_legs/restless_legs.htm#What_is_the_prognosis,http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/restless_legs/restless_legs.htm#Is_there_any_treatment,http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct/search?term=restless+legs+syndrome
19,Rheumatoid arthritis,Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory disease that causes pain swelling stiffness and loss of function in the joints. It occurs when the immune system which normally defends the body from invading organisms turns its attack against the membrane lining the joints.,NIH,http://www.niams.nih.gov/Health_Info/Rheumatic_Disease/default.asp,http://www.niams.nih.gov/Health_Info/Rheumatic_Disease/default.asp#ra_12,http://www.niams.nih.gov/Health_Info/Rheumatic_Disease/default.asp#ra_10,http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct/search;jsessionid=7845C8D9EEE366DFBF9D6BC956DBC486?term=rheumatoid+arthritis
20,Ulcerative colitis,Ulcerative colitis is a disease that causes inflammation and sores called ulcers in the lining of the rectum and colon. Ulcers form where inflammation has killed the cells that usually line the colon then bleed and produce pus. Inflammation in the colon also causes the colon to empty frequently causing diarrhea.,NIH,http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/colitis/,http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/colitis/#causes,http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/colitis/#treatment,http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct/search?term=ulcerative+colitis
