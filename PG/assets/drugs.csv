Four additional amino acid changes were made to facilitate the molecular construction and a corresponding synthetic DNA sequence was constructed using chemical synthesis methodology. Interferon alfacon-1 differs from interferon alfa-2b at 20/166 amino acids (88% homology) and comparison with interferon-beta shows identity at over 30% of the amino acid positions. Interferon alfacon-1 is produced in Escherichia coli (E. coli) cells that have been genetically altered by insertion of a synthetically constructed sequence that codes for Interferon alfacon-1. Prior to final purification Interferon alfacon-1 is allowed to oxidize to its native state and its final purity is achieved by sequential passage over a series of chromatography columns.

106,Letrozole,Letrozole,Letrozole (INN trade name Femara) is an oral non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor that has been introduced for the adjuvant treatment of hormonally-responsive breast cancer.
